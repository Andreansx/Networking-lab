# School Network


Basically, a couple weeks ago, my school was supposedly hit by lightning during a storm.  

It seems that the strike was pretty powerful since it fried a switch in the school network.
At the same time, wireless network went completely down since the Access Points were powered by PoE.   

I won't go into the details of problems that I had with getting into a agreement with the school and I will just document what I can stricttly about the network here.  

The networking equipment was founded by the European Union and I do not know if I can post photos of it here, so I will check with the IT teacher if I can do that.  
He basically knew that I am a networking enthusiast so he asked my friend to ask me if I can fix their WiFi.   

This all will be more of a flow of thoughts rather than a full documentation but I will try to make everything as clean as I can.
