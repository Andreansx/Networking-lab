# Some practice lab for CCNA

I'm not gonna walk through everything from the beginning but I will just write and overview of the technologies used etc.   

## Topology

Don't mind that WLC and that single Access Point.   
I tried a couple of times to make a good split-MAC architecture but I failed to do that.  
However I started blaming Packet Tracer since I checked my configuration a lot of times and it's actually pretty common that Packet Tracer has some bugs.   
After all it only mimics the IOS software and doesn't run the actual IOSv.   
Besides I'm running it on Arch Linux from some weird build so I think this speaks for itself.   
For example, when I create an etherchannel with PAgP, the link lights stay Red (Down) for some reason even when the connection fully works.
