# Amalysis and justification for selecting the Dell EMC S4048-ON switch for my lab


So basically this will be a shorter documentation cause there won't be much going on here, apart from me just explaining why I choose the Dell EMC S4048-ON ToR switch for my lab instead of some other models.    

I kind of want to try writing docs in more concise or formal way so this won't be a flow of thoughts like in, for example, [School network analysis](../13-school-network/readme.md).   

I will shortly compare it to Juniper QFX5100 and Ubiquiti Campus 24 PoE, though I never actually even considered the Ubiquiti one for my lab, but since it is in fact a very popular model, I want to use it just as a comparison for the two other switches.
