> This is gonna be a really big documentation. There is a lot to write but I will try to group the steps in some way even though in reality this was super messy. Swapping routes for BGP routes was not complex in itself but there is a lot of other things that are important.  
> I think it's best to first read a couple of documentations:

> [OSPF Backbone](../06-ospf-backbone/readme.md)
