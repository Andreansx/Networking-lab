## üí° What's This Repository About?

This is the **central documentation hub** for my networking lab ‚Äì it contains everything related to the physical infrastructure, configuration backups, and manual installations. While I'm currently in my second year of high school, I'm building the foundation for my future career in data center operations through hands-on experience with enterprise equipment.

**Important Note:** This repository focuses solely on the lab infrastructure itself. All specific networking projects (BGP, VLAN setups, Terraform deployments, etc.) are maintained in their own dedicated repositories.
