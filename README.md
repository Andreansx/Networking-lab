## üí° What's This Repository About?

This is the **central documentation hub** for my networking lab ‚Äì it contains everything related to the physical infrastructure, configuration backups, and manual installations. While I'm currently in my second year of high school, I'm building the foundation for my future career in data center operations through hands-on experience with enterprise equipment.

**Important Note:** This repository focuses solely on the lab infrastructure itself. All specific networking projects (BGP, VLAN setups, Terraform deployments, etc.) are maintained in their own dedicated repositories.

## üóÇÔ∏è What You'll Find Here

- **Current Device Configurations** - Backups and documentation of running configs
- **Physical Installation Guides** - How I set up copper cables, keystones, rack mounting, etc.
- **Lab Infrastructure Details** - Power, cooling, physical organization
- **Hardware Documentation** - Specifications and setup of physical equipment

## üß™ Lab Highlights

- **Enterprise Hardware**: Dell servers running virtualization platforms, MikroTik routers, and more [‚Üí details](./docs/hardware.md)
- **Carrier-Grade Focus**: Building a foundation in ISP and data center networking concepts
- **Virtualization Environment**: Leveraging Proxmox to maximize learning with limited resources
- **Practical Skills Development**: Real-world infrastructure management experience

## üß† Infrastructure Focus

```diff
+ Optimizing device configurations for better stability
+ Setting up automated configuration backups
+ Improving physical cable management and labeling
- Upgrading home lab power distribution
- Enhancing documentation with network diagrams
```

## üîó Related Project Repositories

While this repository focuses on infrastructure, my actual networking projects live in their own repositories:

- **[BGP Lab ‚Üí](https://github.com/AndreansxTech/networking-bgp-lab)** - Carrier backbone routing simulations
- **[Virtualization Cluster ‚Üí](https://github.com/AndreansxTech/proxmox-lab)** - Proxmox virtualization platform implementation

## üìö Infrastructure Documentation

- **[Hardware Inventory](./docs/hardware.md)** - Detailed equipment specifications
- **[Physical Installations](./docs/keystones-installation.md)** - Guide to cabling, crimping, and rack mounting
- **[Device Configurations](./docs/configurations/)** - Backup directory for all device configs
- **[Network Topology](./docs/topology.md)** - Physical and logical layout of the lab

## üöÄ Learning Journey

While I'm still in high school, I'm building practical, hands-on experience with the technologies that power modern data centers and carrier networks. This lab infrastructure represents my commitment to developing real-world skills through direct implementation rather than just theoretical study.

Every cable run, rack mount, and device configuration here prepares me for my goal of working in large-scale network operations after graduation.
