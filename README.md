## üí° What's This All About?

This repository documents my hands-on networking lab - a practical learning environment where I build real skills with enterprise-grade equipment. While I'm currently in my second year of high school, I'm already building the foundation for my future career in data center operations and carrier-grade networking through practical experimentation rather than just theoretical learning.

## üß™ Lab Highlights

- **Enterprise Hardware**: Dell servers running virtualization platforms, MikroTik routers, and more [‚Üí details](./docs/hardware.md)
- **Carrier-Grade Scenarios**: Simulating ISP routing, data center networking, and backbone infrastructure
- **Virtualization Focus**: Leveraging Proxmox to maximize learning with limited physical resources
- **Practical Skills Development**: Building the exact skills needed in modern data centers

## üìö Documentation Index

- **[Hardware Inventory](./docs/hardware.md)** - The enterprise equipment I've acquired and deployed
- **[Physical Installations](./docs/keystones-installation.md)** - Real-world infrastructure implementations
- **[Network Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)** - My approach to carrier-inspired network design

## üöÄ Learning Journey

While I'm still in high school, I'm building practical, hands-on experience with the technologies that power modern data centers and carrier networks. This lab represents my commitment to developing real-world skills through direct implementation rather than just theoretical study.

Every configuration, cable run, and troubleshooting session here prepares me for my goal of working in large-scale network operations after graduation.
