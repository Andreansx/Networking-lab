<h1>  Networking Lab - Centre   </h1>

<h4>Welcome to my networking lab centre. This is a repository dedicated to be a main overview of my lab. All specific scenarios, deployments etc. will be placed in their own repositories and links to them will be available here</h4>
<h4>I am building this repository because I want to document everything I do on my path to study network engineering, server administration and cloud infrastructure. That is what I am aiming to do at work in the future</h4>

Below, you can look at general overview of the devices that my lab consists of
</br></div>

### **[Server rack](./hpe-10636-g2/readme.md)**

#### My server rack is a **Hewlett Packard Enterprise ASSY 10636 G2**.
* **Height:** 36U
* **Standard:** 19"


### Servers

##### **[Dell PowerEdge R710](./r710/)**
**Really old server. However, for now it is enough, for simple virtualization. Definetly going to replace it. Probably with a R740**
* **CPU:** 2x Intel Xeon X5670 2.30GHz
* **RAM:** 128 DDR3 ECC Samsung and Skhynix memory
* **Disk space:** 1.5 TB combined storage 
* **OS:** Proxmox

##### **[Dell PowerEdge R610](./r610/)**
**This one can be considered as garbage. Single Intel Xeon E5520 with 36 Gigabytes of DDR3 RAM. I will give it away to someone probably.**
### Network devices

##### **[MikroTik CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS](./ccr2004/)**
**Main lab router. Excellent for learning from basic technologies to advanced protocols like OSPF, BGP etc. Overkill for my needs**

##### **[MikroTik CRS326-24S+2Q+RM](./crs326/)**
**Core switch in the lab, capable of L3 functionality. 24 SFP+ ports along with 2 QSFP+ offer a lot of possibilities. Also overkill for this lab**
