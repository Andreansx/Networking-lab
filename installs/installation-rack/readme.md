### I got this rack for around 250 Euros. The seller included some short simple PDUs and also a **HP S1132 PDU.**
## Hewlett-Packard S1132 Power Distribution Unit

The only problem I encountered with this PDU at this time, is that the main power cable is littelary cut off.

*Gonna place a photo here*

Though, that isn't that big of a problem for me, since I have the neccessary equipment to deal with this type of situation, still it's a slow-down for the process of setting up a full lab.
